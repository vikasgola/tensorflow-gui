# TensorFlow-GUI: GSoC 2019
This is the summary of the work done on this project in GSoC 2019. 

## Expected work
This project was expected to develop a software for the deep learning from scratch 
with backend tensorflow.

## Completed
- Created a module to craete a new project and, load and open all created project. 
- Created a module to show training of deep learning models with integrated tensorboard.
- Developed a module where user can create deep learning models by dragging and dropping nodes.
- Implemented some predefined helpful common nodes and an option to create a custom nodes.

## Todo
- More predefined helpful nodes to be added.
- Testing and pre trained models loading of deel learning needs to be implemented.
